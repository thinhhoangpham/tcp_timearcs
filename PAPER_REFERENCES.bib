% ===== USAGE NOTES =====
% 1. Replace @techreport{tcptimearcs_*} entries with proper publication if/when paper is published
% 2. Consider upgrading blog posts (@misc{brager2024pcap}, @misc{moore2023network_forensics})
%    to peer-reviewed sources if available
% 3. Add specific attack dataset entries based on your evaluation (CICIDS2017, etc.)
% 4. Update year fields as needed for final submission
% 5. Verify all DOI links are functional before submission

% ===== BIBTEX FORMATTING TIPS =====
% - Use consistent capitalization: {TimeArcs} preserves case
% - Include DOI whenever available for digital discoverability
% - URLs should use \url{} command in LaTeX document, plain text in BibTeX
% - For conference proceedings, include organization (IEEE, ACM, etc.)
% - Use double dashes (--) for page ranges (converts to en-dash in LaTeX)
